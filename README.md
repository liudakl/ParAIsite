# Compositionally-Restricted Attention-Based Network (CrabNet)

This software package implements the Compositionally-Restricted Attention-Based Network (`CrabNet`) that takes only composition information to predict material properties.
Additionally, it demonstrates several model interpretability techniques that are possible with `CrabNet`.
